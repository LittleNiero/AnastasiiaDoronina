            <h1>Sally Face (game)</h1>
            <p>Sally Face is an indie horror point-and-click Adventure game developed by Steve Gabry.
                The game is broken up into five episodes following the titular character, a boy with
                a prosthetic face, where the player follows as he moves into the Addison Apartments
                with his father following a mysterious murder.</p>
            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p>Delve into a dark adventure following the boy with a prosthetic face and a tragic past.
                Unravel the sinister mysteries of Sally's world to find the truth that lies hidden beneath the shadows.
            </p>
            <h2>Gameplay</h2>
            <p>In this story-driven adventure game, players will interact with Sal's world and his nightmares.
                The main path typically requires casual effort. However, there are hidden layers to be uncovered
                that will invoke a bit of head-scratching, for those players up to the challenge. These include bonus mini-games
                as well as additional narrative.</p>

            <h1>Story and Characters</h1>
            <p>Delve into an unsettling adventure following the boy with a prosthetic face and a tragic past. In the first
                episode, Strange Neighbors, Sally Face and his father move into an apartment filled with odd tenants and an
                unfortunate crime scene. Little did they know what misfortune still awaits...</p>
            <p>At the apartments, they meet an assortment of tenants including:</p>
            <ul class="section_story">
                <li>Larry Johnson, lives in the basement with his mother who introduces him to Sal
                    and they become close friends that investigate the strange happenings that haunt Addison Apartments.</li>
                <li>Mr. Addison, is the landlord of Addison Apartments living in room 103. He remains unseen except for
                    his eyes peeping through the mail slot when spoken to.</li>
                <li>Charley Mansfield, a tenant of Addison Apartments who lives in room 204 and has a
                    large collection of figures and collectibles.</li>
                <li>Chug, a boy who confides in Sal his belief of ghosts roaming the building. He lives in room 303 and is
                    often found outside waiting for his parents to return home from work.</li>
